      <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
      <p>This policy outlines our approach to collecting, processing, and storing personal data for newsletter
      subscriptions in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It ensures that individuals
      have full control over their data and understand how it is used.</p>
      <p><strong>Clear consent</strong></p>
      <p>We collect newsletter subscriptions only through a clear, affirmative opt-in process.
      Subscribers must actively check an unchecked box or click a dedicated "Agree" switch button to give consent.
      Pre-ticked checkboxes or implied consent are not used.</p>
      <p><strong>Data Minimization</strong></p>
      <p>We only collect the necessary data for sending newsletters: Email address (required). </p>
      <p><strong>Opt-out</strong></p>
      <p>Subscribers can opt-out at any time. Every newsletter includes an unsubscribe link that is easy to find and use.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
      <p>Personal data is storedin our database only for the duration of the subscription. If a subscriber opts out, their email
      address and other personal data are deleted unless required by law or for legitimate purposes (e.g., maintaining a suppression list to avoid future emails).</p>
      <p><strong>Secure Data Handling</strong></p>
      <p>We ensure appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect subscribersâ€™ data, such as:
      Encrypting data during transmission. Regular audits of our data storage and processing systems.</p>
